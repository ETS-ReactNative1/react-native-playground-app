# React Native Playground App

![Project version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-informational.svg)

This project will be my playground for different React Native related topics.
To try out stuff, it does not need always a new project, it can be included all in one.

Built with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) SDK 38.
